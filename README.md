This repository contains test programs intended for use with the various LoRaTracker projects. 

Some test programs are universal and can be used on most Arduino platforms, depending on available pins and
libraries.

Some of the test programs will need other library files that are part of the LoRaTracker library
so this will need to be installed;

https://github.com/LoRaTracker/LoRaTracker-Library

The test programs can be used with a LoRaTracker board by defining the appropriate board definition 
file in the program, see the notes in the comments at the start of each program for further details. 
The board definition files are part of the LoRaTracker Library.

Alternativly the microcontroller pins used for each of the test programs are listed in the comments 
at the start of the program and they can be defined explicitly for other hardware. 
 
Some test programs will not run on some LoRaTracker boards, for instance the SD card test will only
run on boards that have a SD card fitted.  

If there are any explanatory notes on how to use the test programs they will be found listed in the 
document;
